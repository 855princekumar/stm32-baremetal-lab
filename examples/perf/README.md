# Performance Testing and Benchmarking with STM32

## Overview

This document provides an overview of performance testing and benchmarking techniques using STM32 microcontrollers. It is designed to help students understand how to measure and analyze the performance of their applications effectively.

## Objectives

- Understand the importance of performance testing in embedded systems.
- Learn how to set up a benchmarking environment for STM32.
- Explore various performance metrics and how to measure them.
- Implement performance tests for different functionalities.

## Performance Metrics

When evaluating the performance of an embedded application, consider the following metrics:

1. **Execution Time**: Measure how long it takes for a specific function or task to execute.
2. **CPU Utilization**: Determine the percentage of CPU time spent on executing tasks.
3. **Memory Usage**: Analyze the amount of RAM and Flash memory used by the application.
4. **Power Consumption**: Measure the power drawn by the microcontroller during operation.
5. **Throughput**: Evaluate the number of operations completed in a given time frame.

## Setting Up the Benchmarking Environment

To perform performance testing on STM32, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Ensure that the STM32 board is properly connected and powered.
2. **Toolchain Installation**: Install the necessary toolchain for building and flashing the firmware (e.g., GCC for ARM).
3. **OpenOCD Configuration**: Use the provided `openocd.cfg` file to set up OpenOCD for debugging and flashing.
4. **Build the Project**: Use the Makefile to compile the performance testing examples.

## Example Performance Tests

### 1. Execution Time Measurement

To measure the execution time of a function, you can use the SysTick timer. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```c
#include "stm32f4xx.h"

void function_to_test(void) {
    // Function logic here
}

void measure_execution_time(void) {
    uint32_t start_time = SysTick->VAL; // Get current SysTick value
    function_to_test(); // Call the function
    uint32_t end_time = SysTick->VAL; // Get SysTick value after execution

    uint32_t execution_time = start_time - end_time; // Calculate execution time
    // Log or display the execution time
}
```

### 2. CPU Utilization

To measure CPU utilization, you can use FreeRTOS or similar RTOS to track task execution times. Analyze the task states and calculate the CPU usage percentage.

### 3. Memory Usage Analysis

Use tools like `heap_4.c` from FreeRTOS to monitor dynamic memory usage. You can also check the linker map file to analyze static memory allocation.

### 4. Power Consumption Measurement

Use an oscilloscope or a power meter to measure the current drawn by the STM32 during different operational states. This will help you understand the power profile of your application.

### 5. Throughput Testing

Implement a simple loop that performs a specific operation (e.g., data transmission) and measure how many operations can be completed in a set time frame.

## Conclusion

Performance testing is crucial for optimizing embedded applications. By following the guidelines and examples provided in this document, students will be able to effectively measure and analyze the performance of their STM32 applications.
