# Timers Lab Guide

## Overview
In this lab, we will explore the timer functionalities of the STM32 microcontroller. Timers are essential components in embedded systems, allowing for precise timing operations, event scheduling, and generating PWM signals. This lab will guide you through configuring and using timers in your STM32 applications.

## Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Understand the basic concepts of timers in STM32.
- Configure timers for different modes of operation.
- Implement a simple application using timers to generate periodic interrupts.
- Utilize timers for PWM signal generation.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, ensure that you have:
- Completed Lab 1 (Blinking LED) and Lab 2 (USART Communication).
- Familiarity with the STM32 development environment and basic C programming.

## Lab Setup
1. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - STM32 development board (e.g., STM32F4 Discovery)
   - USB cable for programming and power
   - LED and resistor (optional, for visual feedback)

2. **Software Requirements:**
   - STM32CubeIDE or any compatible IDE
   - STM32 HAL library (included in the firmware directory)

## Steps
### Step 1: Understanding Timer Basics
- Timers in STM32 can operate in various modes, including:
  - **Basic Timer:** Used for simple timing operations.
  - **PWM Timer:** Used for generating PWM signals.
  - **Input Capture Timer:** Used for measuring input signal characteristics.

### Step 2: Configuring the Timer
- Open the `main.c` file in the `labs/03-timers` directory.
- Initialize the timer using the HAL library functions.
- Configure the timer for the desired mode (e.g., PWM or interrupt).

### Step 3: Implementing Timer Interrupts
- Set up an interrupt service routine (ISR) for the timer.
- In the ISR, toggle an LED or perform another action to demonstrate the timer's functionality.

### Step 4: Generating PWM Signals (Optional)
- If using PWM, configure the timer's output compare mode.
- Connect an LED to the PWM output pin and observe the brightness changes based on the duty cycle.

### Step 5: Testing and Debugging
- Compile the code using the provided Makefile.
- Flash the firmware onto the STM32 board using the `flash.sh` script.
- Monitor the output and verify that the timer operates as expected.

## Conclusion
In this lab, you have learned how to configure and use timers in STM32 microcontrollers. Timers are powerful tools that enable various functionalities in embedded systems, from simple delays to complex signal generation. Experiment with different timer configurations and applications to deepen your understanding.
