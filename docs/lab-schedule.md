## Notes

- Each session will include a hands-on lab where students will implement the concepts discussed.
- Students are encouraged to review the relevant documentation and examples prior to each session.
- The schedule is subject to change based on the pace of the class and any unforeseen circumstances.

## Conclusion

This lab schedule is designed to provide a structured approach to learning STM32 programming. By the end of the sessions, students will have a solid understanding of both basic and advanced concepts in embedded systems development.
