# STM32 Bare Metal Lab Syllabus

## Course Overview
This lab course is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in programming STM32 microcontrollers using bare-metal techniques. Students will learn the fundamentals of embedded systems, including hardware interfacing, peripheral programming, and real-time operating systems (RTOS). The course will cover a series of labs that progressively build on each other, allowing students to develop practical skills and a deep understanding of microcontroller architecture.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand the architecture and features of STM32 microcontrollers.
2. Write and debug bare-metal applications for STM32.
3. Interface with various peripherals such as GPIO, USART, ADC, DAC, I2C, and SPI.
4. Implement timer-based applications and understand their applications in embedded systems.
5. Integrate and utilize an RTOS in embedded applications.
6. Develop a systematic approach to troubleshooting and debugging embedded systems.
